{"id":"sweep-xrt","title":"Fix linting issues in output package tests","description":"## Problem\nMultiple linting issues in output package test files.\n\n## Issues\n1. Unchecked type assertions (14 occurrences) - json_test.go, yaml_test.go, template_test.go\n2. Float comparison in test - json_test.go:55\n3. assert.Len(t, files, 0) should be assert.Empty - json_test.go:77, yaml_test.go:78\n4. assert.Error should be require.Error - output_test.go:185\n5. Unused parameter 'r' - output_test.go:143\n6. Comment missing period - output_test.go:138\n\n## Recommended Fixes\n- Use ok pattern for type assertions: val, ok := x.(Type); require.True(t, ok)\n- Use assert.InEpsilon for float comparisons\n- Use assert.Empty for zero-length checks\n- Use require.Error when error assertion should stop test\n- Rename unused parameters to _\n\n## Why This Matters\n- Unchecked type assertions panic instead of providing useful test failure messages\n- Consistent use of testify assertions improves test readability and error messages","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"42301770+jamesainslie@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T07:40:44.712448-05:00","created_by":"James Ainslie","updated_at":"2026-01-20T07:41:02.763956-05:00"}

{"id":"sweep-zv6","title":"Make daemon large file index threshold configurable","description":"## Problem\n\nThe daemon's large file index threshold is hardcoded to 10 MiB (`DefaultMinLargeFileSize`). \nWhen users query with `-s 1k`, the daemon returns no results because files \u003c 10 MiB aren't indexed.\n\n## Current Behavior\n\n```bash\nsweep -s 1k ~/Downloads           # Returns nothing (daemon)\nsweep -s 1k --no-daemon ~/Downloads  # Works (direct scan)\n```\n\n## Desired Behavior\n\nAllow users to configure the threshold in `~/.config/sweep/config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\ndaemon:\n  # Minimum file size to index for fast queries (default: 10MB)\n  # Lower = more files indexed = larger index but queries work for smaller files\n  min_index_size: 1MB\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Add `MinIndexSize` to `DaemonConfig` in `pkg/sweep/config/config.go`\n2. Pass through to daemon via CLI flag or environment variable\n3. Update `pkg/daemon/server.go` to use configured value\n4. Update `pkg/daemon/indexer/indexer.go` default\n5.
